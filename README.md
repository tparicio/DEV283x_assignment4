You can check the CRUD operations for this REST Api in assignment4 mongo database and accounts collection.

By curl:
```shell
//posts account data

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"balance": "1000", "name": "savings"}' "http://localhost:3000/accounts"

//gets account data

curl "http://localhost:3000/accounts"

//updates account data at specific id, NOTE: replace 'id' in "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id" with the id generated by the previous POST command

curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"balance": "1500"}' "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id"

//deletes account data at specific id, NOTE: replace 'id' in "http://localhost:3000/accounts/id" with the id generated by the previous POST command
